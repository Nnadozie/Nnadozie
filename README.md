## Build the Adventure with DozieðŸš€ ðŸ‘‹

<!--

Hi ðŸ‘‹, you can call me Dozie ðŸ˜„. My friends say I'm a tenacious problem solver and I love taking on challenging problems. I'm also a two-time IBM patent awardee and a growth focused early-career software engineer approaching 5 years of industry experience across different stacks and company sizes, with a current focus on building depth in all things front-end systems.

### My current tools of choice:
- Typescript and JavaScript
- HTML, CSS
- React

If I'm successfull with my self-development plan for the year 2022, I'll be expanding this to include Webflow, and Swift (why Swift and not Flutter, React Native or Android? - DM me on twitter @dozieokk, I'd love to chat with you!).

### In Q1 2022 I:
- completed reading Effective Typescript by Dan Vanderkam - to improve my knowledge of Typescript,
- worked on a [Leetcode contest api](https://github.com/Nnadozie/leetcode-contest-api) (discontinued) - to practice what I read,
- and wrote about both on my blog https://dozie.dev - to share what I was learning

### At the moment I'm working through major self-growth challenges spanning the 2nd to 4th quarters of 2022:
- Growing a [Fronte.io Ltd](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/13322472) product to Â£1000 MRR by 2nd quarter end by focusing on building sleek marketing pages for startups using Webflow.
- 195 days (3 quarters) of Intro to Algorithms by CLRS
- 300 - 1000 words of daily technical writing for 3 quarters
- 130 days (2 quarters) of implementing one data structure or one algorithm
- 26 weekends (2 quarters) of competing in one leetcode contest
- 65 days of [TypeScript challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges)

and I will be sharing my progress publicly on Twitter @dozieokk.

### In the future
I'd like to:
 - continue learning how to build massively parallel, concurrent and distributed systems for financial applications.
 - make out the time to build out another [passion project](https://www.figma.com/proto/SGuw31bQRw87e82HV9vOas/House-Points?node-id=343%3A2931&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=14%3A27&starting-point-node-id=343%3A2931), which is the reason I may be learning Swift later this year.

### How to reach me
The best way to reach me is via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nnadozie-okeke/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dozieokk), or e-mail at dozie@fronte.io.

### Mentorship
People tend to reach out to ask about CV, career, job application, or technical advise. If you're planning to do this, please reach out on Twitter, but please keep in mind that I'm also still figuring out this thing called life ðŸ˜… and all my answers typically involve YOU doing a ton of work.

### Recruiters
I'm currenly most open to roles offering work visa sponsorship for the UK. Other than these, I'm open to fully remote roles which overlap with the GMT timezone.
