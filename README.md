## Build the Adventure with DozieðŸš€ ðŸ‘‹

<!--

Hi ðŸ‘‹, you can call me Dozie ðŸ˜„. My friends say I'm a tenacious problem solver and I love taking on challenging problems. I'm also a two-time IBM patent awardee and a growth focused early-career software engineer approaching 5 years of industry experience across different stacks and company sizes, with a current focus on building depth in all things front-end systems.

### My current tools of choice:
- Typescript and JavaScript
- HTML, CSS
- React

If I'm successfull with my self-development plan for the year 2022, I'll be expanding this to include Webflow, and Swift (why Swift and not Flutter, React Native or Android? - DM me on twitter @dozieokk, I'd love to chat with you!).

### At the moment I'm currently:
- reading Effective Typescript by Dan Vanderkam - to improve my knowledge of Typescript
- working on a Leetcode contest percentile analyser - to practice what I'm reading, and
- and writing about both on my blog https://dozie.dev - to share what I'm learning

### I'm also currently:

- working through relevant aspects of Intro to Algorithms by CLRS, Leetcode tutorials, and Cracking the Coding Interview, and
- attempting to practice leetcode problems daily

to get faster at solving difficult leetcode problems so that I can overcome my coding interviewing anxiety, and better apply myself to technical problems I may face in real life. My goal is to rank consistently in the 90th percentile on leetcode contests. Right now I rank in the 30th - 40th percentile so still a long way to go.

The best way to reach me is via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nnadozie-okeke/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dozieokk), or e-mail at dozie@fronte.io.

### In the future
I'd like to continue learning how to build massively parallel, concurrent and distributed systems for financial applications.

### Mentorship
People tend to reach out to ask about CV, career, job application, or technical advise. If you're planning to do this, please reach out on Twitter, but please keep in mind that I'm also still figuring out this thing called life ðŸ˜… and all my answers typically involve YOU doing a ton of work.

### Recruiters
I'm currenly most open to roles offering work visa sponsorship for the UK. Other than these, I'm open to fully remote roles which overlap with the GMT timezone.
