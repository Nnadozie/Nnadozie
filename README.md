Hi ðŸ‘‹, you can call me Dozie ðŸ˜„. My friends say I'm a tenacious problem solver and I love taking on challenging problems. I'm also a two-time IBM patent awardee and a growth focused early-career software engineer approaching 5 years of industry experience across different stacks and company sizes, with a current focus on building depth in all things front-end systems.

### My current tools of choice:
- Typescript and JavaScript
- HTML, CSS
- React
- MongoDB
- Heroku
- AWS
- NestJs
- Express
